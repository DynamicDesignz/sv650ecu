### Code

 * __sv650_reader__ This is the code which runs on the SV650 ECU Decoder and decodes the messages sent by the ECU.
 * __sv650_generator__ This is code written for an Arduino to emulate an SV650 ECU.
 * __sv650_temp__ This is code I wrote to walk through all the ADC temp values generated by the ECU to figure out how to map them to degrees fareinheit.

### Important!

The sv650_reader and sv650_generator code uses the SoftwareSerial library to talk to (or emulate) the Suzuki SV650 ECU which runs at 7800 BAUD.  However, the SoftwareSerial library does not support that speed natively.  In order to add support 7800 BAUD you will need to edit SoftwareSerial.c and add this line to the 16Mhz struct:
 
```c
{ 7800,     138,       291,       291,      287,   },
```                                                            

The numbers are based off the info in [this thread](http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,138497.0.html) in the Arduino forums.
