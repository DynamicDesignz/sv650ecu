### Code

 * __sv650_reader__ This is the code which runs on the SV650 ECU Decoder and decodes the messages sent by the ECU.
 * __sv650_generator__ This is code written for an Arduino to emulate an SV650 ECU.
 * __sv650_temp__ This is code I wrote to walk through all the ADC temp values generated by the ECU to figure out how to map them to degrees fareinheit.
 * __SWSerial7800__ Customized version of NewSoftSerial library with support for 7800 baud

### Important

In order to build sv650_reader, sv650_generator and sv650_temp for Arduino, you will
need to import the 7800Serial library into the Arduino IDE.  To do so:
 1. Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library
 2. Select the SWSerial7800 directory
 3. Click the "Choose" button
